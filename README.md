Insurance Data Analysis Dashboard
🏦 Insurance Data Analysis Dashboard

🔹 Summary
Developed an interactive dashboard to analyze insurance policy trends, customer demographics, and claim patterns for data-driven decision-making.

 🔍 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing insurance data to uncover patterns in policy distribution, claims, and customer segments. The goal was to create an interactive dashboard that provides stakeholders with actionable insights into business performance, customer behavior, and potential areas for cost optimization.

❓ Problem Statement
Insurance companies deal with massive amounts of policy and claims data. Without proper analysis, it is difficult to:
* Identify which customer segments contribute the most revenue
* Monitor claims frequency and fraud risk
* Optimize policy offerings and pricing strategies

This project aims to solve these problems by building a structured dashboard for data exploration and decision support.
📂 Dataset

* Size & Features:

  * \~10,000+ records
  * Key columns: `Customer_ID`, `Age`, `Gender`, `Region`, `Policy_Type`, `Premium`, `Claims`, `Claim_Amount`, `Policy_Term`

 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

* **Data Cleaning & Analysis**: Excel
* **Visualization**: Power BI 

🧩 Methods
1. **Data Cleaning** – handled missing values, removed duplicates, standardized formats
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – analyzed customer demographics, policy types, claims distribution
3. **Feature Engineering** – created new fields like claim ratio, premium per year
4. **Dashboard Development** – built interactive charts for:

   * Premium contribution by policy type
   * Claims by age group and gender
   * Regional distribution of policies
   * Loss ratio trends

🔑 Key Insights
* Health policies generated the highest premium revenue (40%) but also had the highest claim ratio.
* Customers aged **30–45** had the maximum claim frequency.
* Region **South-East** contributed 35% of total premiums, showing strong market concentration.
* Female customers had slightly higher average claim amounts than male customers.

 📊 Dashboard / Model / Output

* Filters for age, gender, region, and policy type
* KPIs: Total Premiums, Claims Paid, Loss Ratio, Customer Segments
